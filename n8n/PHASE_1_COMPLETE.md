## 🏗️ Architecture Implementation

### Document Processing Flow (Exactly as per README)
```
Document Upload → Quality Check → Route Decision
    ↓                    ↓              ↓
High Quality      Medium Quality   Low Quality
    ↓                    ↓              ↓
Auto Process    → Enhanced OCR   → Human Review
    ↓                    ↓              ↓
Standard CV     → Validation     → Manual Entry
    ↓                    ↓              ↓
    ├─────────── Final Database ────────┤
```

### ✅ Smart Routing Logic (Per README Thresholds)
- **Quality ≥ 75**: Fully automated processing (75% of documents)
- **Quality 50-74**: Enhanced processing + auto-validation (20% of documents)  
- **Quality < 50**: Human verification required (5% of documents)

#### 4. Data_Extraction_Primary.json
- ✅ Multi-tier extraction approach:
  - **AI-Powered**: High quality (≥75) - HuggingFace Donut simulation
  - **Hybrid**: Medium quality (50-74) - OCR + pattern matching
  - **Basic OCR**: Low quality (<50) - simple text extraction
- ✅ Field-specific extraction based on document type
- ✅ Confidence scoring for extracted fields
- ✅ Processing metrics and timing
- ✅ Automatic validation and routing

#### 5. Smart_Router.json
- ✅ Intelligent routing decisions based on quality and confidence
- ✅ Processing tier management (High/Medium/Low)
- ✅ Cost optimization following README pricing:
  - High Quality: $0.02 per document
  - Medium Quality: $0.15 per document  
  - Low Quality: $0.25 per document
- ✅ Workflow orchestration and statistics tracking
- ✅ Human review queue management

## 📊 Expected Performance (Per README)

### Processing Distribution
- **75% High Quality**: Fully automated ($0.02 each)
- **20% Medium Quality**: Enhanced processing ($0.15 each)
- **5% Low Quality**: Human review required ($0.25 each)

### Average Cost per Document
```
Expected: (75% × $0.02) + (20% × $0.15) + (5% × $0.25) = $0.0575
```

### Time Savings (Per README Goals)
- **Current Manual Processing**: 45-60 minutes per candidate
- **With IMP System**: 5-10 minutes per candidate
- **Time Savings**: 85% reduction in processing time
